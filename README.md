# Storefront sassy child
Blank Woothemes Storefront child theme with SASS, GULP and browser-sync.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have node and nom installed.
2. Correct `proxy` and `port` in `browserSync.init` to match your server configuration.
3. Run `npm install` from this directory in command line.
4. Run `gulp`.

After running `gulp` browser sync will open your local server page in your browser...

Go ahead and make changes to your scss/css/js/php files and watch browser auto reload and show changes :wink:

Happy coding ;)
